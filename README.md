## Commands
69. play
The play command is a pretty coolcommand that allws you to play music to a channel in discord did I say it was pretty cool because it is it is the best command made allowing you to listen to music with everyone in the voicechannel with you without the play command bass might as well have a ping command because it is the most useful command every made
420. pause
The pause command is a command that isnt as cool as a play command it allows you to pause the music playing in the channel best for times when you want to not be playing music but not very useful because who would pause music when there is no need you know what I mean well anyways its still not even as cool as a ping command
